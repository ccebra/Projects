# Projects

Here are some data analysis projects I worked on in various classes. They include:
* Turbine Emissions Project: Group mock consulting project in Professional Statistics class. Project consisted of preliminary meetings with the "client" to determine the study question and a project timetable. Using real-world data of a plant's turbine emissions, the goal was to identify significant variables and test different models and model assumptions. We considered linear and LASSO regression models, decision trees and random forests in this experiment. The project was conducted in R and Python.

* Traffic Crashes Project: Small group mock consulting project in Big Data Analysis class. Used large (~400 MB) dataset on traffic crashes in the City of Chicago from the Chicago Data Portal to analyze primary varaibles that were causes of crashes, using LASSO and other models. Also used the time-sensitive nature of the dataset to test the impact of traffic safety improvements like traffic calming measures and bike lanes over this period. This project was conducted in R and Python.

* Divvy Bike Program Project: Solo capstone project for minor in GIS (Geographic Information Science). Aimed to measure the scope of network increases to the Divvy bikeshare program in Chicago from its inception in 2013 to 2022. The final objective was to create an R data and functions package, and to create an RShiny interactable toolbar showing the network by month. This project was conducted in R, QGIS, and GeoDa.

* COVID Superspreader Events Project: This project was conducted using public health COVID case data from summer and fall 2020 to analyze the impact of so-called "superspreader events" over this period. This project was conducted in QGIS.
